# Networks-of-Adversities

This script reproduces key analyses from analyses from ["Networks of Adversity in Childhood and Adolescence and their Relationship to Adult Mental Health"](https://psyarxiv.com/e5xmn). Please cite the paper if you are re-using some of the code we present here.

With this R Markdown code, we visualize data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and investigate adverse experiences in childhood and adolescence and its effects on mental health in early adulthood using network analysis. Data to reproduce the results can be obtained upon request from the [ALSPAC.](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/)  

We conducted two network analyses to compare the interrelations of childhood and adolescent adversities as well as their relationships to early adulthood mental health and well-being.  

* We determined whether adversity clusters can be detected. 
* We assessed node strength centrality in the childhood and adolescence networks. 
* We calculated which nodes function as "bridges" connecting adversity clusters with             mental  health issues.
* Using a network comparison test, we determined whether the networks of classical               adversities and mental health differs between childhood and adolescence.
* We analysed the direct connections of the most central mental health outcomes with the         adversities in both ages using path diagrams.
